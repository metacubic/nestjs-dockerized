> We've added a **Pull Request** to update the original code from **MWANGO**, to include [OpenApi | Swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/).
> > Other than the pull request, nothing else but the original code is the same. We followed the 'Tutorial' from the original author, and added the OpenApi | Swagger to the project.
> > Everything else added, is from the Meta³ team, and is not part of the original code, but **UPDATED** to work with the original code.

#### About the project:
> As we build this project, we are looking at ways to make life a little easier, in an industry that is currently overpopulated with too many singularities, all wanting the same custom, but a lot of the time not giving back.
> Money does make the world go round, under our current system, but we are looking at ways to make it easier for the community to get involved, and to make it easier for the community to get paid, for their work.
> 
> Content creators get missed a lot, even though for the most part of the industry, they are the ones funding the industry, and the ones that are making the industry grow. However, the industry is not giving back to the community, 
> and in someways, they are actually committing fraud against the creators, that they use and abuse with false promise. It's not just within the content industry, but also other industries, that are using the same tactics.
> 
> Using Decentralised Technology, we can utilise the power of cryptography, by using the blockchain, to create a system that is transparent, and can be audited, and can be used to pay creators, 
> for their work. Giving a **True RealWorld Value** to the work that they do, that's not volatile, against an inflated market, but meets **RealWorld** standards. Community Run, Community Owned & Community Driven.
